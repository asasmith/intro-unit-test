# Introduction to writing unit tests with AVA

This repository serves as a gentle introduction to writing JavaScript [unit](https://dev.to/jackmarchant/no-excuses-write-unit-tests) tests with [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava).

The `getAmount()` function and the motivation to refactor it were taken from NodeSchool's [JavaScript Best Practices workshop](https://github.com/excellalabs/js-best-practices-workshopper).

## Getting started

- fork and clone this repo
- `npm install` or `yarn install`
- `npm test` to lint with [standard](https://standardjs.com) and run the tests with [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
- `npm run lint` to lint only
- happy learning ... pull requests welcome!
