# Introduction to writing unit tests with AVA

This repository serves as a gentle introduction to writing JavaScript [unit](https://dev.to/jackmarchant/no-excuses-write-unit-tests) tests with [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava).

The `getAmount()` function and the motivation to refactor it were taken from NodeSchool's [JavaScript Best Practices workshop](https://github.com/excellalabs/js-best-practices-workshopper).

The `orderTotal()` function was taken from the [Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q) video series on [Unit Tesing in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeF_zoW9o66wa_UCNE3a7BEr). Thanks @mpj!

## Getting started
